<h2>Overview</h2>
In the competitive telecom industry, understanding customer needs and service performance is crucial. A leading telecom company required an insightful dashboard to visualize call centre trends and provide actionable insights into customer and agent behaviors. The goal was to create a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard that captures key metrics and trends over time.


<h2>Goal</h2>
The primary goal was to design a Power BI dashboard that provides a clear and detailed view of long-term call centre operations. This dashboard would serve as a valuable tool for management to make strategic decisions and drive performance improvements.


<h2>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Metrics:</h2>

- Overall Customer Satisfaction: Measuring customer feedback and satisfaction scores to gauge service quality.
- Calls Answered vs. Abandoned: Tracking the total number of calls handled versus those that were abandoned to understand call handling efficiency.
- Calls by Time: Analyzing the distribution of calls throughout different times of the day to identify peak hours and staffing needs.
- Average Speed of Answer: Measuring the average time taken to answer a call to assess response efficiency.
- Agent Performance Quadrant: Evaluating agents based on average handle time (talk duration) and the number of calls answered to identify high and low performers.

<h2>Approach</h2>
I utilized Power BI to design a user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard. The dashboard employed various visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to ensure the data was easily interpretable. This approach highlighted critical aspects of call centre performance, making important trends and insights clear.


<h2>Results</h2>
The resulting dashboard provided a transparent and detailed view of the call centre's performance, allowing the client to make informed decisions. By visualizing data trends, the dashboard helped in identifying areas for improvement, recognizing high-performing agents, and making strategic staffing and operational decisions.
